puts "My unexpected trip to the Galapagos islands began on #{leave_date}. On my cab ride to my two star hotel #{hotel} I managed to spy #{iguanas_viewed} Iguanas. The next day I traveled to the unoriginally named #{best_beach} to conduct my research on the #{giant_tortoises_viewed} tortoises that had unexpectedly migrated.  After a week of documentation I returned home on #{return_date}. Overall I recorded #{iguanas_viewed.to_i + giant_tortoises_viewed.to_i} creatures."
